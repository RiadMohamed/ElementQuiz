# ElementQuiz

The app is made of an image view, interactive label. And 2 buttons. The label text is interactive with the current element showing or if the user chose to view the answer. The first button is to reveal the answer in case the user couldn’t figure out the element on his own from the image being displayed. The second button will replace the current element with the next one for the user to guess, resetting the label back to “?”
